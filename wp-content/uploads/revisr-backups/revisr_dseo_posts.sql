It\'s used to style text, images, and other page elements, and control their positioning on webpages. CSS saves time because you can change the look of everything on your page—or just one element or section—with a simple line of code. After you have mastered HTML, CSS is the logical next step.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>CSS Fundamentals</em> covers the basic concepts, terminology, and techniques you need to read and write CSS. It\'s for people who want a big-picture overview before taking hands-on courses.

Presented by the GRAMMY foundation, the camp served as an opportunity to bring some of the most talented youth in music together for a comprehensive weeklong collaborative training. Various tracks were offered including electronic music production, singer/songwriter, music journalism, performance, and audio engineering.\r\n\r\nAs part of the audio engineering program I helped record and mix about a dozen original songs written by my peers. Highlights included working with a full ProTools Icon interface, lectures from Gavin Rossdale, an audio engineering workshop with four-time GRAMMY award winning mixer Manny Marroquin, and touring the iconic Motown Records building in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nThe year after the camp I went on to spend my senior year in High School founding a recording club and raising money by recording all student music concerts and selling CD\'s.

It\'s used to style text, images, and other page elements, and control their positioning on webpages. CSS saves time because you can change the look of everything on your page—or just one element or section—with a simple line of code. After you have mastered HTML, CSS is the logical next step.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>CSS Fundamentals</em> covers the basic concepts, terminology, and techniques you need to read and write CSS. It\'s for people who want a big-picture overview before taking hands-on courses. Author James Williamson explains how CSS affects text, borders, backgrounds, and images; how CSS works with HTML; and how the W3C\'s evolving CSS specification impacts designers. He also reviews some of the most popular CSS editors and frameworks and lists online tools and resources for further study.\n<div class=\"course-description-topics\">\n\nTopics include:\n<ul>\n 	<li>What is CSS?</li>\n 	<li>Basic selector types</li>\n 	<li>Using CSS with HTML</li>\n 	<li>How browsers render CSS differently</li>\n 	<li>Exploring CSS specifications</li>\n 	<li>Checking browser support</li>\n 	<li>Working with fonts</li>\n 	<li>Understanding the box model</li>\n 	<li>Adjusting margins and padding</li>\n 	<li>Positioning elements</li>\n 	<li>Basic CSS layout concepts</li>\n 	<li>Media types and media queries</li>\n 	<li>Working with CSS frameworks and CSS grids</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n[/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=\"JavaScript Essential Training\"] Use JavaScript to add new features and a richer, more compelling user interface on web pages.

Presented by the GRAMMY foundation, the camp served as an opportunity to bring some of the most talented youth in music together for a comprehensive weeklong collaborative training. Various tracks were offered including electronic music production, singer/songwriter, music journalism, performance, and audio engineering.\n\nAs part of the audio engineering program I helped record and mix about a dozen original songs written by my peers. Highlights included working with a full ProTools Icon interface, lectures from Gavin Rossdale, an audio engineering workshop with four-time GRAMMY award winning mixer Manny Marroquin, and touring the iconic Motown Records building in Los Angeles.\n\nThe year after the camp I went on to spend my senior year in High School founding a recording club and raising money by recording all student music concerts and selling CD\'s. These funds were used to create the schools very own recording studio. The legacy was continued when I helped my predecessor Johnny Bugarin attain acceptance to GRAMMY Camp 2010\n\n[/et_pb_text][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][/et_pb_section]','Coursework','','inherit','closed','closed','','48-autosave-v1','','','2016-06-26 15:53:29','2016-06-26 15:53:29','',48,'http://denverseocoach.com/48-autosave-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(167,1,'2016-06-24 13:48:02','2016-06-24 13:48:02','','ancillary_uce','','inherit','open','closed','','ancillary_uce','','','2016-06-24 13:48:02','2016-06-24 13:48:02','',48,'http://denverseocoach.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ancillary_uce.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(168,1,'2016-06-24 13:59:21','2016-06-24 13:59:21','[et_pb_section fullwidth=\"off\" specialty=\"off\" admin_label=\"Section\"][et_pb_row admin_label=\"Row\"][et_pb_column type=\"1_3\"][et_pb_image admin_label=\"Image\" src=\"http://denverseocoach.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ancillary_uce.png\" show_in_lightbox=\"off\" url_new_window=\"off\" use_overlay=\"off\" animation=\"off\" sticky=\"off\" align=\"left\" force_fullwidth=\"off\" always_center_on_mobile=\"on\" use_border_color=\"off\" border_color=\"#ffffff\" border_style=\"solid\" module_class=\"img-padding-center\" /][/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=\"2_3\"][et_pb_text admin_label=\"Text\" background_layout=\"light\" text_orientation=\"left\" use_border_color=\"off\" border_color=\"#ffffff\" border_style=\"solid\"]\r\n<h2><strong>University of Colorado Denver</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Bachelors of Science, Business Marketing, Music Business Minor; Graduated 2015</h3>\r\nI started at UCD studying recording arts and music business.

Last, Morten covers the professional tools and techniques you need to use when you\'re developing sites for clients, including setting up a staging environment and version control.\r\n<div class=\"course-description-topics\">\r\n\r\nTopics include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Setting up WordPress on a live host</li>\r\n 	<li>Setting up a local development environment</li>\r\n 	<li>Creating and publishing content</li>\r\n 	<li>Managing media</li>\r\n 	<li>Adding a new child theme</li>\r\n 	<li>Building custom sites for clients</li>\r\n 	<li>Syncing content between local and staging servers</li>\r\n 	<li>Making a site live</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n[/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=\"WordPress: Custom Post Types and Taxonomies\"]\r\n\r\nBy default WordPress has five post types (posts and pages are the most popular), organized using built-in taxonomies like categories and tags. However, you can extend the functionality of WordPress and display different types of content according to your own rules by creating custom post types and taxonomies. In this course, Morten Rand-Hendriksen shows how to create a plugin for new post types and taxonomies, create new post types and taxonomies (hierarchal and nonhierarchal), and build templates that display the custom post types and taxonomies in new and effective ways.\r\n<div class=\"course-description-topics\">\r\n\r\nTopics include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>What are WordPress custom post types and taxonomies</li>\r\n 	<li>Creating and testing the plugin</li>\r\n 	<li>Creating posts with custom post types</li>\r\n 	<li>Building basic custom taxonomies</li>\r\n 	<li>Creating custom post type templates</li>\r\n 	<li>Including custom post types in the front page index</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n[/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=\"WordPress: Building Themes from Scratch Using Underscores\"]\r\n\r\nReady for your next WordPress challenge? Learn how to build more complex custom themes using the _s (aka Underscores) starter theme. Morten Rand-Hendriksen takes you from basic layout and customization to enabling advanced responsive design and accessibility features. He reinforces the basics lessons with DRY (don\'t repeat yourself) development practices and a structured approach that will help you build WordPress themes that meet modern standards. Plus, he explores core concepts like understanding the WordPress template hierarchy and mobile-first design, creating functions, adding custom JavaScript, applying styles, and more. Plus, for 2016, we\'re including an all-new chapter on the Customizer, which provides controls that allow users of your theme to adjust the colors and layout.\r\n<div class=\"course-description-topics\">\r\n\r\nTopics include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Installing WordPress, Underscores, plugins, and NetBeans</li>\r\n 	<li>Creating a modular, mobile-first WordPress theme</li>\r\n 	<li>Setting up the basic theme</li>\r\n 	<li>Building a custom header</li>\r\n 	<li>Designing responsive, accessible menus</li>\r\n 	<li>Configuring the Single Post Template plugin</li>\r\n 	<li>Generating featured images</li>\r\n 	<li>Styling the comments area, search results, and widget areas</li>\r\n 	<li>Working with static pages</li>\r\n 	<li>Adding features to the Customizer</li>\r\n 	<li>Customizing the backend</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n[/et_pb_accordion_item][et_pb_accordion_item title=\"Installing and Running WordPress: MAMP\"]\r\n\r\nInstalling WordPress on your computer gives you a perfect testing ground for experimentation, theme development, plugin testing, and website development.

Lynda is a collection of professional video tutorials on a wide array of topics. These videos always taught by subject matter experts and cover techniques, workflows, and industry best practices. Many of the Lynda courses surpass the quality of my higher education courses.\r\n\r\nTo make the most of what I learn, I will typically watch a course when I already have a need or application for the new skill in mind. I will then watch the video, take rich media notes using Evernote or WordPress, and then immediately put my new skills to work. By doing this I retain knowledge through application and repetition, and create reference notes for later.

Presented by the GRAMMY foundation, the camp served as an opportunity to bring some of the most talented youth in music together for a comprehensive weeklong collaborative training. Various tracks were offered including electronic music production, singer/songwriter, music journalism, performance, and audio engineering.\r\n\r\nAs part of the audio engineering program I helped record and mix about a dozen original songs written by my peers. Highlights included working with a full ProTools Icon interface, lectures from Gavin Rossdale, an audio engineering workshop with four-time GRAMMY award winning mixer Manny Marroquin, and touring the iconic Motown Records building in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nThe year after the camp I went on to spend my senior year in High School founding a recording club and raising money by recording all student music concerts and selling CD\'s. These funds were used to create the schools very own recording studio. The legacy was continued when I helped my predecessor Johnny Bugarin attain acceptance to GRAMMY Camp 2010\r\n\r\n[/et_pb_text][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][/et_pb_section]','Coursework','','inherit','closed','closed','','48-revision-v1','','','2016-06-25 05:09:05','2016-06-25 05:09:05','',48,'http://denverseocoach.com/48-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(179,1,'2016-06-25 05:13:19','2016-06-25 05:13:19','','imgres-1','','inherit','open','closed','','imgres-1','','','2016-06-25 05:13:19','2016-06-25 05:13:19','',48,'http://denverseocoach.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/imgres-1.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(180,1,'2016-06-25 05:16:58','2016-06-25 05:16:58','[et_pb_section fullwidth=\"off\" specialty=\"off\" admin_label=\"Section\"][et_pb_row admin_label=\"Row\"][et_pb_column type=\"4_4\"][et_pb_gallery admin_label=\"Gallery\" fullwidth=\"off\" show_title_and_caption=\"on\" show_pagination=\"off\" background_layout=\"light\" auto=\"off\" hover_overlay_color=\"rgba(255,255,255,0.9)\" caption_all_caps=\"off\" use_border_color=\"off\" border_color=\"#ffffff\" border_style=\"solid\" /][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][/et_pb_section][et_pb_section admin_label=\"Section\" fullwidth=\"off\" specialty=\"off\" transparent_background=\"off\" background_color=\"#494949\" allow_player_pause=\"off\" inner_shadow=\"off\" parallax=\"off\" parallax_method=\"off\" padding_mobile=\"off\" make_fullwidth=\"off\" use_custom_width=\"off\" width_unit=\"on\" make_equal=\"off\" use_custom_gutter=\"off\" custom_css_main_element=\"padding-top:40px !important;||padding-bottom:40px !important;\"][et_pb_row admin_label=\"Row\" make_fullwidth=\"off\" use_custom_width=\"off\" width_unit=\"on\" use_custom_gutter=\"off\" padding_mobile=\"off\" allow_player_pause=\"off\" parallax=\"off\" parallax_method=\"off\" make_equal=\"off\" parallax_1=\"off\" parallax_method_1=\"off\" parallax_2=\"off\" parallax_method_2=\"off\" column_padding_mobile=\"on\" custom_css_main_element=\"padding-left: 10% !important;||padding-right: 10% !important;\"][et_pb_column type=\"1_3\"][et_pb_image admin_label=\"Image\" src=\"http://denverseocoach.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ancillary_uce.png\" show_in_lightbox=\"off\" url_new_window=\"off\" use_overlay=\"off\" animation=\"off\" sticky=\"off\" align=\"left\" force_fullwidth=\"off\" always_center_on_mobile=\"on\" use_border_color=\"off\" border_color=\"#ffffff\" border_style=\"solid\" module_class=\"img-padding-center\" max_width=\"300px\"] [/et_pb_image][/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=\"2_3\"][et_pb_text admin_label=\"Text\" background_layout=\"dark\" text_orientation=\"left\" use_border_color=\"off\" border_color=\"#ffffff\" border_style=\"solid\"]\r\n<h2><strong>University of Colorado Denver</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Bachelors of Science, Business Marketing, Music Business Minor; Graduated 2015</h3>\r\nI started at UCD studying recording arts and music business.

Presented by the GRAMMY foundation, the camp served as an opportunity to bring some of the most talented youth in music together for a comprehensive weeklong collaborative training. Various tracks were offered including electronic music production, singer/songwriter, music journalism, performance, and audio engineering.\r\n\r\nAs part of the audio engineering program I helped record and mix about a dozen original songs written by my peers. Highlights included working with a full ProTools Icon interface, lectures from Gavin Rossdale, an audio engineering workshop with four-time GRAMMY award winning mixer Manny Marroquin, and touring the iconic Motown Records building in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nThe year after the camp I went on to spend my senior year in High School founding a recording club and raising money by recording all student music concerts and selling CD\'s. These funds were used to create the schools very own recording studio. The legacy was continued when I helped my predecessor Johnny Bugarin attain acceptance to GRAMMY Camp 2010\r\n\r\n[/et_pb_text][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][/et_pb_section]','Coursework','','inherit','closed','closed','','48-revision-v1','','','2016-06-25 05:16:58','2016-06-25 05:16:58','',48,'http://denverseocoach.com/48-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(181,1,'2016-06-25 05:26:33','2016-06-25 05:26:33','','Grammy-Tile','','inherit','open','closed','','grammy-tile','','','2016-06-25 05:26:33','2016-06-25 05:26:33','',48,'http://denverseocoach.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Grammy-Tile.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(182,1,'2016-06-25 05:26:34','2016-06-25 05:26:34','','lynda-tile','','inherit','open','closed','','lynda-tile','','','2016-06-25 05:26:34','2016-06-25 05:26:34','',48,'http://denverseocoach.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lynda-tile.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(183,1,'2016-06-25 05:26:36','2016-06-25 05:26:36','','ucd-tile','','inherit','open','closed','','ucd-tile','','','2016-06-25 05:26:36','2016-06-25 05:26:36','',48,'http://denverseocoach.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ucd-tile.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(184,1,'2016-06-25 05:26:37','2016-06-25 05:26:37','','udemy-tile','','inherit','open','closed','','udemy-tile','','','2016-06-25 05:26:37','2016-06-25 05:26:37','',48,'http://denverseocoach.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/udemy-tile.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(185,1,'2016-06-25 05:34:05','2016-06-25 05:34:05','[et_pb_section admin_label=\"Section\" fullwidth=\"off\" specialty=\"off\"][et_pb_row admin_label=\"Row\"][et_pb_column type=\"4_4\"][et_pb_gallery admin_label=\"Gallery\" fullwidth=\"off\" show_title_and_caption=\"off\" show_pagination=\"off\" background_layout=\"light\" auto=\"off\" hover_overlay_color=\"rgba(28,28,28,0.25)\" caption_all_caps=\"off\" use_border_color=\"off\" border_color=\"#ffffff\" border_style=\"solid\" gallery_ids=\"183,182,184,181\" hover_icon=\"%%41%%\" module_class=\"wide-grid\"] [/et_pb_gallery][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][/et_pb_section][et_pb_section admin_label=\"Section\" fullwidth=\"off\" specialty=\"off\" transparent_background=\"off\" background_color=\"#494949\" allow_player_pause=\"off\" inner_shadow=\"off\" parallax=\"off\" parallax_method=\"off\" padding_mobile=\"off\" make_fullwidth=\"off\" use_custom_width=\"off\" width_unit=\"on\" make_equal=\"off\" use_custom_gutter=\"off\" custom_css_main_element=\"padding-top:40px !important;||padding-bottom:40px !important;\"][et_pb_row admin_label=\"Row\" make_fullwidth=\"off\" use_custom_width=\"off\" width_unit=\"on\" use_custom_gutter=\"off\" padding_mobile=\"off\" allow_player_pause=\"off\" parallax=\"off\" parallax_method=\"off\" make_equal=\"off\" parallax_1=\"off\" parallax_method_1=\"off\" parallax_2=\"off\" parallax_method_2=\"off\" column_padding_mobile=\"on\" custom_css_main_element=\"padding-left: 10% !important;||padding-right: 10% !important;\"][et_pb_column type=\"1_3\"][et_pb_image admin_label=\"Image\" src=\"http://denverseocoach.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ancillary_uce.png\" show_in_lightbox=\"off\" url_new_window=\"off\" use_overlay=\"off\" animation=\"off\" sticky=\"off\" align=\"left\" force_fullwidth=\"off\" always_center_on_mobile=\"on\" use_border_color=\"off\" border_color=\"#ffffff\" border_style=\"solid\" module_class=\"img-padding-center\" max_width=\"300px\"] [/et_pb_image][/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=\"2_3\"][et_pb_text admin_label=\"Text\" background_layout=\"dark\" text_orientation=\"left\" use_border_color=\"off\" border_color=\"#ffffff\" border_style=\"solid\"]\r\n<h2><strong>University of Colorado Denver</strong></h2>\r\n<h3>Bachelors of Science, Business Marketing, Music Business Minor; Graduated 2015</h3>\r\nI started at UCD studying recording arts and music business.

Various tracks were offered including electronic music production, singer/songwriter, music journalism, performance, and audio engineering.\r\n\r\nAs part of the audio engineering program I helped record and mix about a dozen original songs written by my peers. Highlights included working with a full ProTools Icon interface, lectures from Gavin Rossdale, an audio engineering workshop with four-time GRAMMY award winning mixer Manny Marroquin, and touring the iconic Motown Records building in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nThe year after the camp I went on to spend my senior year in High School founding a recording club and raising money by recording all student music concerts and selling CD\'s. These funds were used to create the schools very own recording studio.

Presented by the GRAMMY foundation, the camp served as an opportunity to bring some of the most talented youth in music together for a comprehensive weeklong collaborative training. Various tracks were offered including electronic music production, singer/songwriter, music journalism, performance, and audio engineering.\r\n\r\nAs part of the audio engineering program I helped record and mix about a dozen original songs written by my peers. Highlights included working with a full ProTools Icon interface, lectures from Gavin Rossdale, an audio engineering workshop with four-time GRAMMY award winning mixer Manny Marroquin, and touring the iconic Motown Records building in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nThe year after the camp I went on to spend my senior year in High School founding a recording club and raising money by recording all student music concerts and selling CD\'s. These funds were used to create the schools very own recording studio. The legacy was continued when I helped my predecessor Johnny Bugarin attain acceptance to GRAMMY Camp 2010\r\n\r\n[/et_pb_text][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][/et_pb_section]','Coursework','','inherit','closed','closed','','48-revision-v1','','','2016-06-25 06:08:10','2016-06-25 06:08:10','',48,'http://denverseocoach.com/48-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0);
